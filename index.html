            <p>
                This website tells the story of how I came to implement <em>VenStipe</em>. I'll explain what it is, or at least, supposed to be, in due time because, when this story started, I was nowhere near think of it. I hope this project sees it's implementation finished, one day. Finished or not, I will tell its whole story here. From a certain point on, that I'll mention, as it happens.

            <p>I won't go into the the discussion of what is original or if original actually exists but I'll list the sequence of events, feelings and ideas that led to me wanting to implement <em>VenStipe</em>.</p>

            <h3>The connected dots</h3>

            <p>There were three major factors that set me on this path:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>I like time waster games</h4>
                    <p>
                        I like time waster casual games, mostly those that require brain usage providing, what I call, an active rest. Games like:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                <em>2048</em>

                    <p>Anyone can find me playing those on my work breaks, on the bus or while walking on the street by myself.</p>
                </li>

                <li>
                    <h4>I like software development</h4>
                    <p>I make a living as a software developer. I've been doing so since 2008. That story is told <a href="http://bigsby.github.io/" target="_blank">here</a>. For this story, it's important to note that: I'm very fond of generics and sharing funcionality, i.e., implementing things in a one-size-fits-all, non-functionally-repetitive fashion; I try (almost) everything that crosses my path and regards to software development.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>I don't like repeating completed things</h4>
                    <p>
                        Being a technology person, I regularly change device and platform, test new operating systems, and so on. It solemnly annoys me that, every time I change something, all progress is lost: high scores in <em>2048</em> and levels complete in <em>Flow</em> and <em>Flow: Bridges</em>. My highest score in <em>2048</em> 6x6 took me about two months.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Time wasting and curiousness</h3>

            <p>
                I was playing <em>2048</em> and strolled to the about section that says: <blockquote>Based on 2048 by Gabriele Cirulli</blockquote> ...and provided a link to the <a href="http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/" target="_blank"><em>GitHub.io</em> page of the original game</a>. My curious self visited that page and that page pointed me to the <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/"><em>GitHub</em> repository where the source code</a> of the game was. It's implemented in <a href="https://www.javascript.com/" target="_blank"><em>JavaScript</em></a> and so, the game I was playing, is for sure (although I didn't and won't make any effort to confirm), implemented using something like <a href="https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/latest/guide/platforms/wp8/" target="_blank"><em>Cordova</em></a> that, basically, generates an application that opens a web browser and runs the web page in it.
            </p>

            <h3>A sequence of events</h3>
            <span class="tick">2015 Late December</span>
            <p>
                I decided to port <em>2048</em> to <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/a72418yk.aspx" target="_blank"><em>C#</em></a>. Along the way, I decided to put some use to my <a href="https://github.com/bigsby" target="_blank"><em>GitHub</em> account</a> and start sharing something on it. So I created my first <em>GitHub</em> repository, <a href="https://github.com/bigsby/2048.net" target="_blank">2048.net</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/Bigsby/2048.net/tree/0c7c06c2ac241bfa9de27498001a8623ea30dc66" target="_blank">ported the <em>JavaScript</em> code to <em>C#</em></a>. I let it snooze for a while. I created a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130(v=vs.110).aspx" target="_blank"><em>WPF</em></a> project to use it but that wasn't a very sharable platform.
            </p>

            <p>
                I had used <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/forms" target="_blank"><em>Xamarin Forms</em></a>, professionally, but, althgough its first version was, as first versions usually are, quite limited in funcionality, one could see that its creation was a big step in the right direction. When version 2 came out I had to give it a go. It's always hard to come up with ideas, at least, good ones, to test a technology. So, I had my <em>C#</em> port of <em>2048</em> parked and I wanted to try out <em>Xamarin Forms</em>. The result was an implementation of the game in <em>Xamarin Forms</em> that I made sure worked on <em>iOS</em>, <em>Android</em> and <em>Windows 10</em> desktop, Mobile and IoT on a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/" target="_blank"><em>Raspberry Pi 3</em></a> I had just bought "for the kids".
            </p>

            <p>
                I implemented the gameplay and storing game state and high scores locally, as the <em>JavaScript</em> version does, but, after that, I <strong>had to</strong> implement a service to store those remotely so that high scores, first, and game state, after, would be shared cross instances of the game. I.e, when I stop playing in my <em>iPad</em> and, afterwards, I pickup playing in my <em>Raspberry Pi</em>, I'm exactly in the same point in the game.
            </p>

            <h3>The idea</h3>

            <p>
                As I said before, I'm very fond of implementing things in a sharable way so, in this case, I would create a service that all games I implemented could/would use. But, if I was to implement a service for my games to use, <strong style="text-decoration: underline">why not implement a service that all games could use?</strong>
            </p>

            <p>
                It was clear that I <strong>had to</strong> implement such a service that all game developers could (easily) use to provide such funcionalilty as game state (e.g., high scores and  progress) storing to share cross-instances of the game.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="theStart">
            <h1>The Start</h1>

            <h3>Brainstorming</h3>
            <span class="tick">2016 Late March</span>
            <p>
                The idea was born: <strong style="text-decoration: underline">a service that provides storing of game states for all game developers</strong>. I, immediately, discussed the idea with two very close friend developers. I can track the first Skype chat about <em>VenStipe</em> to the 29<sup>th</sup> March 2016. The more I discussed the purpose and of the project and the tons of things that could (will) be implemented around it, the more I was convinced I had to do it.
            </p>

            <p>
                I did some research on existing services and found that there isn't <strong>one</strong> that is platform agnostic and, in more conversations, more ideas on what to do around the service came about, like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>List high scores for a specific game particularly</li>
                <li>Notifications of high scores beaten</li>
                <li>Host tips, tricks and solutions</li>
                <li>Integration with existing services</li>
                <li>...and many more...</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <span class="tick">2016 May, the 4th</span>
            <p>
                As a developer, I tend to make the mistake of putting my hands to the task before putting everything into documentation and, thus, settle how and what things should be. I created a <a href="https://github.com/Bigsby/VenStipe" target="_blank"><em>VenStipe</em> repostory</a> in my own <em>GitHub</em> account and created a <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank"><em>Visual Studio</em></a> solution with the projects, at the time, I thought were neeeded for the whole service:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>An objects definition library</li>
                <li>A Web API project that would talk to a database in the backend</li>
                <li>A Web Site with two faces: for game developers; for gamers</li>
                <li>A PCL client of the Web API for game developers to use</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Naming</h3>
            <p>
                This was a very productive day. In the same day, I had a discussion with my two fellow friend developers on how to call the service. There were two ideas I wanted reflected in the name, somehow: game and gathering. I had, from start, the idea of using latin as the base for the name although I looked at the word <em>game</em> in other languages (actually, all <a href="https://translate.google.com/" target="_blank">Google Translate</a> supported, at the time). Here is a list of some possible names that came by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>oneludos</li>
                <li>omniludos</li>
                <li>allludos</li>
                <li>alludos</li>
                <li>gamestipe</li>
                <li>ludoszone</li>
                <li>ludozone</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <em>VenStipe</em> comes from the latin words <em>venatus</em>, that means <em>game</em> (or <em>hunt</em>) and <em>Stipes</em>, that means <em>club</em>. Later, I realized <em>Stipes</em> means <em>club</em> as batting club or bat and not club as an association. But, when that happen, the choice was already made and the domain was already registered. The name is short easy to pronounce and to remember.

        <div id="poCing">
            <h1>PoCing</h1>
            <span class="tick">2016 first half of May</span>
            <p>
                During this period I made some scafolding implementations the live on the <em>GitHub</em> <a href="https://github.com/Bigsby/VenStipe" target="_blank">repository on my account</a>. There were some options that I knew, even before I started, would be used:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Hosting</h3>
                    <p>
                        I never had any doubt <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Windows Azure</a> would be the options. I've had an account on <a href="https://www.arvixe.com/" target="_blank">Arvixe</a> for a long time that I use to test stuff but is no candidate for something that requires numbers and performance. There's no point in telling the not so good experiences I had with other cloud hosting like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS (Amazon Web Services)</a>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Web API</h3>
                    <p>
                        I've implemented too many Web API in <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc" target="_blank">ASP.Net MVC</a> and played enough with <a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">NodeJS</a> to know better.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                On other areas, I wasn't so sure and did some research:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Database</h3>
                    <p>
                        Being <em>VenStipe</em> a service where, most likely, there will be data that is event-like, e.g., user <em>x</em> made a (personal) high score on game <em>y</em>, it seemed obvious that a non-relational database woudl be used. After some resarch around <em>NoSql </em> I found <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> had released, without me knowing, a <em>NoSQL</em> database of their, and on <em>Windows Azure</em> which I had already chosen for hosting. The choice had to fall on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/documentdb/" target="_blank">Azure DocumentDB</a>. I did some PoCing on it and it does, very fast, way more than <em>VenStipe</em> needs.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Web Site(s) technologies</h3>
                    <p>
                        Here the discussion could never end and there is so/too much to choose from.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Client Framework</h4>

                    <p>
                        <a href="https://angularjs.org/" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> or <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout</a>? Coming from <em>WPF</em>, I played with <em>Knockout</em> when it came out and tried to bring <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848246.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank">MVVM</a> to the web clients. <em>Knockout</em> was great and I had never <em>Angular</em> but some research, PoCing and some talks with my collegue <a href="http://blog.drinkbird.com/" target="_blank">Tasos</a> made it obvious that <em>Angular</em> was the way to go. The next question was whether to use <em>Angular 1</em> (now known as AngularJS 1) or <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular 2</a>. It didn't take much to choose <em>Angular 2</em>, also, because it was meant to be used with <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Stylesheet pre-processor</h4>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">{less}</a> or <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>. I must confess I'm not a front-end guy and asked an expert for an educated opinion and it didn't take long for me to opt for <em>{less}</em>.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Client library compiler</h4>
                    <p>
                        <a href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank">Gulp</a> or <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a>. I just think the streaming approach of <em>Gulp</em> makes way more sense than the configuration approach of <em>Grunt</em>. It was a no-brainer.
                    </p>

            <p>As I said before, one of my many faults is, as developer, getting my hands dirty before defining exactly what and I things are to be done. As I want to do this "the right way", I'll try to document everything before I do it. For that I created a repository just to hold all the documentation about this project. This process is described <a href="docs/github/createRepo.html">here</a>.</p>
